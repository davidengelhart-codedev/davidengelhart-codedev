- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidengelhart-(codedev --> license plate) or David Engelhart
- 👀 I’m interested in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Terraform/IaC, and Go
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go
- 📫 Most of my code contributions and projects I have done in the past decade+ are on private repos of orgs so they cannot be shown/shared here. And have used a couple of different GitHub accounts/BitBucket accounts since then.
